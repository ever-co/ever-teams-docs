# Internationalization (i18n)

Ever Teams supports 13 languages using [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) for the web application.

## Supported Languages

| Code | Language   | RTL     |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| `en` | English    | No      |
| `fr` | French     | No      |
| `ar` | Arabic     | **Yes** |
| `bg` | Bulgarian  | No      |
| `zh` | Chinese    | No      |
| `nl` | Dutch      | No      |
| `de` | German     | No      |
| `he` | Hebrew     | **Yes** |
| `it` | Italian    | No      |
| `pl` | Polish     | No      |
| `pt` | Portuguese | No      |
| `ru` | Russian    | No      |
| `es` | Spanish    | No      |

## How It Works

### Routing

All user-facing routes include a `[locale]` segment:

```
/en/dashboard       → English dashboard
/fr/dashboard       → French dashboard
/ar/dashboard       → Arabic dashboard (RTL)
```

### Translation Files

Translation files are JSON files stored in `apps/web/locales/`:

```
locales/
├── en.json      # English translations
├── fr.json      # French translations
├── ar.json      # Arabic translations
├── bg.json      # Bulgarian translations
├── zh.json      # Chinese translations
├── de.json      # German translations
└── ...          # Other locales
```

### Usage in Components

```typescript
import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';

function TaskList() {
  const t = useTranslations('tasks');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new JSON file in `apps/web/locales/` (e.g., `ja.json`)
2. Add the locale code to `docusaurus.config.ts` locales array
3. Translate all keys from `en.json`
4. The new language appears in the locale switcher

### Crowdin Integration

Translation management is handled via [Crowdin](https://ever.crowdin.com/ever-teams), enabling community contributions:

- Source strings are extracted from the English locale
- Translators work on Crowdin's web interface
- Translated strings are synced back to the repo

## Mobile App i18n

The mobile app (`apps/mobile`) has its own i18n setup using React Native's localization capabilities with translation files in `apps/mobile/app/i18n/`.

## Desktop App i18n

The desktop app (`apps/desktop/i18n/`) has its own translation resources for Electron-specific UI strings.
